# 🌟 AStar Visualizer - Interactive Pathfinding Algorithm Demo

**AStar Visualizer** is an intuitive and educational tool that visualizes the **A\*** (A-Star) pathfinding algorithm in real time. Built using **Python** and **Pygame**, this application helps you understand how algorithms navigate complex grids by setting start and end points, creating barriers, and watching the shortest path come to life.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **Accurate A\*** pathfinding algorithm
- 🎨 Real-time, interactive visualization on a grid
- 👆 Click-based placement of start, end, and barrier nodes
- ⌨️ Keyboard controls to run or reset the simulation
- 👶 Beginner-friendly and ideal for learning graph-based algorithms
