# A* Pathfinding Visualizer

A real-time visualizer for the A* pathfinding algorithm built with Python and Pygame.  
This application allows you to interactively set start and end points on a grid, define barriers, and visualize the process of finding the shortest path using the A* algorithm.

---

## Features

- Interactive grid interface using Pygame.
- Left click to set start point, end point, and barriers.
- Right click to reset cells.
- Visualizes open, closed nodes and the final shortest path.
- Use the SPACE key to start the pathfinding algorithm.
- Use the C key to clear the grid and start fresh.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed.

2. Install Pygame library:

   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

4. Controls:

   - **Left Click**:  
     - First click sets the **start node** (orange).  
     - Second click sets the **end node** (turquoise).  
     - Further clicks create **barriers** (black).

   - **Right Click**: Reset the clicked node to empty (white).

   - Press **SPACE** to start the A* algorithm and visualize the pathfinding.

   - Press **C** to clear the grid and reset start/end points.

## How It Works

- The grid is divided into square nodes, each corresponding to a pixelated cell on the window.
- The algorithm uses Manhattan distance as the heuristic (`h()` function).
- Neighbors are computed for each node, excluding barriers.
- The visualization updates the colors of nodes as the algorithm:
  - Opens nodes (green),
  - Closes nodes (red),
  - Traces the final path (purple).
- Start and end nodes have distinct colors for clarity.

---

## Customization

- You can adjust the grid size by changing the `ROWS` variable in `main()` function.
- Colors and window dimensions can be modified at the top of the script.
- The algorithm can be enhanced to support diagonal movement or different heuristics.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pygame
