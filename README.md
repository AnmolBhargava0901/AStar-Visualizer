# 🌟 AStar Visualizer - Interactive Pathfinding Algorithm Demo

**AStar Visualizer** is an intuitive and educational tool that visualizes the **A\*** (A-Star) pathfinding algorithm in real time. Built using **Python** and **Pygame**, this application helps you understand how algorithms navigate complex grids by setting start and end points, creating barriers, and watching the shortest path come to life.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🧠 **Accurate A\*** pathfinding algorithm
* 🎨 Real-time, interactive visualization on a grid
* 👆 Click-based placement of start, end, and barrier nodes
* ⌨️ Keyboard controls to run or reset the simulation
* 👶 Beginner-friendly and ideal for learning graph-based algorithms

---

## 🧰 Requirements

* Python 3.7 or above
* Pygame library

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

---

## 📂 Project Structure

```
AStarVisualizer/
├── astar_visualizer.py    # Main script to run the visualizer

## 🎮 How to Use

### ▶️ Run the Script

```bash
python astar_visualizer.py
```

### 🕹️ Controls

* 🖱️ **Left Click**: Set **start**, **end**, or **barrier**
* 🖱️ **Right Click**: Erase any cell
* ␣ **Spacebar**: Start the pathfinding algorithm
* 🧹 **C Key**: Clear the entire grid
