# 🌟 AStar Visualizer - Interactive Pathfinding Algorithm Demo

**AStar Visualizer** is an intuitive and educational tool that visualizes the **A\*** (A-Star) pathfinding algorithm in real time. Built using **Python** and **Pygame**, this application helps you understand how algorithms navigate complex grids by setting start and end points, creating barriers, and watching the shortest path come to life.

## 🚀 Features

* 🧠 **Accurate A\*** pathfinding algorithm
* 🎨 Real-time, interactive visualization on a grid
* 👆 Click-based placement of start, end, and barrier nodes
* ⌨️ Keyboard controls to run or reset the simulation
* 👶 Beginner-friendly and ideal for learning graph-based algorithms

---

## 🧰 Requirements

* Python 3.7 or above
* Pygame library

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

To add a photo (or GIF demo) in your README, you can use Markdown image syntax like this:

```markdown
![AStar Demo](https://your-image-hosting.com/path/to/image.gif)
```

### ✅ Example (Using GitHub Repository)

If you're uploading the image to the same GitHub repo, place your image (e.g., `demo.gif`) in your project folder and use:

```markdown
![AStar Demo](./demo.gif)
```

Or, if it's in a subfolder like `assets/`:

```markdown
![AStar Demo](assets/demo.gif)
```

### 📤 Free Hosting Options

If you don't want to keep the image in your repo, you can upload it to:

* [Imgur](https://imgur.com/)
* [Postimages](https://postimages.org/)
* [GitHub Issues (drag image into a new issue and copy link)](https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo/issues)

Let me know if you want me to generate a placeholder image or GIF demo for you.
